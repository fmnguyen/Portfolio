                <h1>Front-End Developer, Aspiring Educator, Datavis Geek</h1></br>

                <p>Hi, I'm Francis. I'm a Senior at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu" target="_blank">University of Washington</a> navigating a mix of engineering and design in the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics/what-is-informatics" target="_blank">Informatics program</a> with focuses in Human Computer Interaction and Data Science.</p></br>

                <p>I am passionate about the intersection of technology, data visualization, and education. More specifically, I’m interested in how data visualization and visual techniques (animation, color, etc.) can help students understand complex topics. I believe in the power of education and want to lend a hand in crafting the future of it.</p></br>

                <p>Between school, spending time in <a href='http://www.slatecoffee.com/' target="_blank">cafes</a> and being part of the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/CUST0MS' target="_blank">local music scene</a>, I love drinking/talking about <a href='http://www.saintfrankcoffee.com'>coffee</a>, discovering new <a href="http://soundcloud.com/fmnguyen" target="_blank">music</a>, and playing Super Smash Bros. Melee.</p></br>

                <p>If you'd like to chat or if anything interests you, I'd love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:fmnguyen@uw.edu">Shoot me an email</a>.</p></br>

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Oblige is a clothing, accessory and experience design company based out of Seattle. Shortly after finding a manufacturer in Seattle and releasing a soft opening of their first product, the Tourne jacket, Oblige reached out to me to help them build an online web presense. I worked with them to develop and deploy an online shop and website as their main online touch point with customers to experience the brand and the products.</p>

                    <h2>Building Oblige</h2>
                    <p>I discussed with one of the co-founders what they wanted the brand to exude. After seeing the jacket and some ideas for branding, we decided on <strong>sleekness</strong>, <strong>elegance</strong>, and <strong>inspiration</strong>. Using the jacket as a focal point, we choose to use a monochrome palette, thinking that accented hues would detract from the all-black products. Leveraging social media, word of mouth and FOMO to drive traffic to the website, the site was designed mobile first, relying entirely on scroll for the user to navigate through different images. The site was built to feature one product at a time, to focus on the high-quality, elegant feel of each individual product's design.</p> 
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img class="middle-img col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2" src="./assets/images/oblige/oblige-site.png" alt="oblige-site"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Choosing to build the page from the ground up, with minor plugins, I hosted the service on a Digital Ocean droplet, and leveraged some basic jQuery and HTML/SASS to put the site together, as I wanted to reduce load time as much as possible. Under the same token, I chose to use SVGs and their correlating animations and transitions for many icons due to their lightweight file size.

                    <h2>20XX: Space Wars</h2>
                    <p>In a future where dueling spaceships is a hobby... just kidding! Space Wars was originally a vintage vector graphics arcade game released in the 1970's. The game featured two players navigating a black screen, “space”, while attempting to shoot the other down with bullets. The main catch was a “star” in the middle, gravitating both players and bullets alike into the central black hole where they disappeared. As a result, players had to strategically aim and time shots as well as navigate around the star to hit their opponent.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>While this timeless rendition of Space Wars was originally designed for 2 players, my hackathon team and I decided to make this a much larger multiplayer experience at Facebook’s Regional Seattle Hackathon. Not only did we want to re-develop a browser version of the original, we wanted to see the ensuing chaos from having tens of players on screen. Utilizing Socket.IO’s support of web sockets, we connected up to 30 players concurrently at the hackathon. As one of the developers, I wrote the physics engine, helped on defining the packet protocol and some of the front-end work to render the spaceship shapes using HTML5 Canvas.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>Wanting to experiment with a new library at the time, we wrote a Node.js server to route a series of connections with web browsers via support from the JavaScript library Socket.IO. Socket.IO makes connection of web sockets remarkably easy, so we learned it pretty intuitively at the hackathon. Realizing we wouldn't have enough time to create a sprite sheet or use Unity, we employed HTML5 Canvas to draw the both the player and the bullets, and also built the physics and collision detection engines from scratch. In the time frame of the hackathon, we managed to create different game rooms via sessions, as well as implementing secure web sockets. </p>
                    <p>Whenever the player inputs navigation (arrow keys) or fires a bullet (space-bar), the web browser sends the server the throttled value of the key-press event. The server then processes the data and updates a “master” version of the game stored on the server. It then sends updates to each of the players involved, in order to guarantee that gameplay is synchronous. While this entire process occurs, the local players' inputs are updated on their client in order to provide a seamless user experience when dealing with latency.</p>

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Fridgit is a smart refrigerator and companion mobile app designed to assist users reduce their food waste and encourage them to make responsible decisions about the foods they have. It was built as a project in a computer science HCI class at the University of Washington where my group and I were tasked with designing a solution to food waste. </p>
                    <p>Having never formally learned the iterative design process before, I used the class as an initial foray into the field of human centered design, where I focused on the user research, graphic design, UI engineering, and mobile app design. I designed various concepts and visual content for the project and helped lead the other members of my group through the iterative design process. I worked alongside three computer science students who were all interested in learning more about design.</p>
                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p>After some initial research and digging around, we found that American households waste around 25 percent of the food products they buy. Many people usually forget about the foods that they have, don’t know much about proper food storage, or end up buying too much food to consume themselves.</p>

                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>One of the key things we noticed during testing was people identified the same themes when discussing food waste: forgetfulness of inventory, or more generally, a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-action_gap'>behavior-intention gap</a>. Most people didn’t intend to waste food, but forgetfulness and too much food made them waste food. As such, most of our iterations were aimed to solve specific tasks that targeted the behavior-intention gap, such as caring about the issue of food waste or deciding on what and how much food to buy.</p>  
                    <p>Working as the main UI/UX designer, I conducted various contextual inquiries, user interviews, usability tests and designed all of the presentations, reports and the UI for the application. I was also responsible for the design and implementation of the responsive website. From a developer view, this was a step outside of roles I took, however taught me an incredible amount of the design process and user experience design.</p>
                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>Two internal cameras and weight sensors are used inside the Fridgit to dynamically update its inventory on an embedded computer. Fridgit also tracks how long food items have been in the fridge, how long they have until they spoil, food usage statistics, and features a manual add feature when adding leftovers or take-out foods. The companion app auto-updates a shopping list of food items when Fridgit notices that you’re running out of a particular food.</p>

                    <p>Mortality rates, access to affordable healthcare, gross national income (GNI), and the enrollment rates of tertiary education facilities are very important to the welfare of a state, but how much do these indicators vary in developed versus developing nations? Working with 3 other students, we chose to investigate this question further by looking at data from the World Databank. Specifically, data was gathered from 10 different countries - 5 developed and 5 developing, and we tracked 9 indicators, including Total Urban/Rural population, mortality rates, and GNI.</p>
                    <p>When first coming across the massive dataset, the first thing on my agenda was to get comfortable with the data. It was crucial to know what data was missing, which indicators were necessary, and how to approach the data. I then proceeded to scrub the data of null values as they would affect statistical tests, and organized the data into separate CSV files for each country and into one large master dataset. I imported them all into R to run both general statistical summaries and correlation tests. I then took each of the indicators and plotted the correlation matrices between each of them.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>For the generation of initial exploratory charts, I found that keeping the relevant countries in a master dataset was a more effective method for generating charts. By adding extra contextual information like the country name as well as whether it was developed or undeveloped, it was easier to visualize the categorical differences in the data. Eventually, in an attempt to make the data exploration more accessible to viewers, I ported the visualizations onto the web using D3.js.</p>
