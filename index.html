                        <h1>Information Visualization Researcher, Creative Developer</h1></br>

                        <p>Hi, I'm Francis! I am an information visualization researcher in <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/"
                                target="_blank">EECS</a> at Northwestern University where I am advised by Professor <a
                                href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/index.html" target="_blank">Jessica
                                Hullman</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/"
                                target="_blank">Midwest Uncertainty Collective</a>, a cross-institution research lab
                            committed to exploring the intersection of information visualization and uncertainty
                            communication. </p></br>

                        <p>My research interests rest at the confulence of education, information visualization, and
                            design. More specifically, I’m interested in how readers interpret visualizations and
                            and
                            how visual techniques, such as animation, color, etc. lead to better communication of
                            seeingly complex
                            topics. Areas I believe this to particularly impactful are the education of statistics,
                            statistical/data literacy
                            and scientific journalism. </p></br>

                        <p>Currently, I am working on
                            visualization tools to support journalists integration of readers' beliefs into
                            articles, and on the evaluation of visualizations to make them statistically reliable.
                            Previously, I have <a href="https://medium.com/hci-design-at-uw/atlas-of-me-personalized-spatial-analogy-maps-for-unfamiliar-measurements-e20566d94b52"
                                target="_blank">
                                worked</a> on <a href="http://measurements.contextvis.com" target="_blank">projects</a>
                            that aid reader comprehension
                            of unfamiliar measurements and on a project that <a href="https://medium.com/@uwdata/hypothetical-outcome-plots-hops-help-users-separate-signal-from-noise-870d4e2b75d7"
                                target="_blank">animates discrete outcomes (HOPs)</a> to understand how readers can use
                            them to make everyday judgements of uncertainty. </p> </br>

                        <p>Between research, coding, spending time in <a href='http://www.slatecoffee.com/' target="_blank">cafes</a>
                            and being part of the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/CUST0MS' target="_blank">local
                                music scene</a>, I love drinking and learning about <a href='http://www.saintfrankcoffee.com'>coffee</a>,
                            cooking, and

                            <p>Oblige is a clothing, accessory and experience design company based out of Seattle.
                                Shortly after finding a manufacturer in Seattle and releasing a soft opening of their
                                first product, the Tourne jacket, Oblige reached out to me to help them build an online
                                web presense. I worked with them to develop and deploy an online shop and website as
                                their main online touch point with customers to experience the brand and the products.</p>

                            <h2>Building Oblige</h2>
                            <p>I discussed with one of the co-founders what they wanted the brand to exude. After
                                seeing the jacket and some ideas for branding, we decided on <strong>sleekness</strong>,
                                <strong>elegance</strong>, and <strong>inspiration</strong>. Using the jacket as a
                                focal point, we choose to use a monochrome palette, thinking that accented hues would
                                detract from the all-black products. Leveraging social media, word of mouth and FOMO to
                                drive traffic to the website, the site was designed mobile first, relying entirely on
                                scroll for the user to navigate through different images. The site was built to feature
                                one product at a time, to focus on the high-quality, elegant feel of each individual
                                product's design.</p>
                            <div class="img-container">
                                <img class="middle-img col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2" src="/dest/assets/images/oblige/oblige-site.png"
                                    alt="oblige-site" />
                            </div>
                            <p>Choosing to build the page from the ground up, with minor plugins, I hosted the service
                                on a Digital Ocean droplet, and leveraged some basic jQuery and HTML/SASS to put the
                                site together, as I wanted to reduce load time as much as possible. For the carousel, I
                                used a lightweight library called Sly.js, and utilized some basic scroll throttling
                                from Underscore. For the same reason of keeping load time as low as possible, I chose
                                to use SVGs and their correlating animations and transitions for many icons due to
                                their lightweight file size. As to not utilize potentially laggy animations, I built
                                out each SVG animation with CSS transitions and animations over JS based ones. The
                                animations and motion design was configured in such a way to be as clean as possible,
                                while still providing context to navigate from the splash page to the product product.</p>

                                featured two players navigating a black screen, “space”, while attempting to shoot the
                                other down with bullets. The main catch was a “star” in the middle, gravitating both
                                players and bullets alike into the central black hole where they disappeared. As a
                                result, players had to strategically aim and time shots as well as navigate around the
                                star to hit their opponent.</p>

                            <p>While this timeless rendition of Space Wars was originally designed for 2 players, my
                                hackathon team and I decided to make this a much larger multiplayer experience at
                                Facebook’s Regional Seattle Hackathon. Not only did we want to re-develop a browser
                                version of the original, we wanted to see the ensuing chaos from having tens of players
                                on screen. Utilizing Socket.IO’s support of web sockets, we connected up to 30 players
                                concurrently at the hackathon. As one of the developers, I wrote the physics engine,
                                helped on defining the packet protocol and some of the front-end work to render the
                                spaceship shapes using HTML5 Canvas.</p>

                            </div>
                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>Wanting to experiment with a new library at the time, we wrote a Node.js server to route
                                a series of connections with web browsers via support from the JavaScript library
                                Socket.IO. Socket.IO makes connection of web sockets remarkably easy, so we learned it
                                pretty intuitively at the hackathon. Realizing we wouldn't have enough time to create a
                                sprite sheet or use Unity, we employed HTML5 Canvas to draw the both the player and the
                                bullets, and also built the physics and collision detection engines from scratch. In
                                the time frame of the hackathon, we managed to create different game rooms via
                                sessions, as well as implementing secure web sockets. </p>
                            <p>Whenever the player inputs navigation (arrow keys) or fires a bullet (spacebar), the web
                                browser sends the server the throttled value of the key-press event. The server then
                                processes the data and updates a “master” version of the game stored on the server. It
                                then sends updates to each of the players involved, in order to guarantee that gameplay
                                is synchronous. While this entire process occurs, the local players' inputs are updated
                                on their client in order to provide a seamless user experience when dealing with
                                latency.</p>
                            <h2>Future Work</h2>
                            <p>Though our team thought we would just work on the game as a part of the hackathon, we
                                briefly brainstormed a list of things we would do differently, or features to build
                                out. One of the biggest was improving the latency issues that we had. While the game
                                worked fine locally on the same network with a large number of players, it would run
                                many times slower given users were geographically further apart. Therefore, the most
                                important algorithm that we wanted to implement was lag compensation. Should time allow
                                and one of us decides to pull the project out to continue working on, lag compensation
                                would be at the top of the list.</p>

                            <h2>About</h2>
                            <p>How often do you encounter measurements while reading online news articles or other text
                                documents? Imagine that today you encounter an article that describes forest fires
                                breaking out in Spain just 4.3 miles from a well-known city. The reporter informs you
                                that the fires have already consumed 5,000 acres of land. The fire sounds close to the
                                city, and destructive, but how close, and how much destruction? Can you really relate
                                to these statistics?</p>
                            <p>Designers and journalists often try to create <i>spatial analogies</i> to address these
                                problems in understanding: re-expressing unfamiliar measurements in terms of
                                measurements that are more familiar to their user. For example, a reporter might
                                mention 4.3 miles is the distance from the University of Washington to the Space
                                Needle, however if you are not familiar with Seattle, you will have no idea what these
                                benchmarks mean! This is because <i>our experience of space is individualized.</i></p>
                            <p>To scale spatial measurement analogies to each individual person, I helped develop a
                                chrome extension, Atlas of Me. It generates spatial analogies for a user based on an
                                address that they specify. The extension identifies measurements and country
                                measurement, and provides the spatial analogy when the user clicks on any particular
                                measurement. As one of the researchers on the project, I collaborated with <a href="http://students.washington.edu/yeaseul1/"

                            <h2>How People Experience Space</h2>
                            <p>To design Atlas of Me, we had to understand what makes spatial analogies useful. Through
                                consulting research on the psychology of space, known as <i>cognitive cartography</i>:
                                the study of how we experience and build mental models of spatial information. The work
                                indicates the importance of <i>landmarks</i> necessary since we rely on them for for
                                orienting and navigating in space.</p>
                            <p>To form the set of landmarks generally significant to users, we scraped around 240,000
                                locations through Yelps API. This gave us names and latitude and longitudes of
                                locations which provides <i>distance landmarks</i> for us, landmarks used to generate
                                distance analogies, say 4.3 miles or 800km. For <i>area</i> analogies, we decided to
                                focus on other types of landmarks: public parks, campgrounds, botanical gardens, arenas
                                and stadiums from our Yelp dataset. We also added US States as many US citizens have
                                some understanding of their own state and surrounding states in terms of area.</p>

                            <h2>Visualizing the Analogies</h2>
                            <p>Finally, after aggregating all of our distance and area landmarks, we present the best
                                analogy for each measurement and location that Atlas parses in an article. In order for
                                the user to contextualize their distance analogy, we display the submitted location of
                                the user and the selected landmark. For the distance analogies, we decided to use
                                Leaflet to generate the map. This allows us to use our predefined latitude and
                                longitude locations that were scraped via the Yelp API. For our area analogies, we
                                present the landmark’s area and polygon using D3.js.</p>

                                storage, or end up buying too much food to consume themselves.</p>
                            <p>After some initial research and digging around, we found that American households waste
                                around 25 percent of the food products they buy. Many people usually forget about the
                                foods that they have, don’t know much about proper food storage, or end up buying too
                                much food to consume themselves.</p>
                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>Without much understanding of the knowledge of food storage and food waste in
                                households, we interviewed students and young working professionals and performed
                                contextual inquiries in their homes to get a better idea of their needs, concerns, and
                                problems. This proved extremely informative, as each provided us access to their
                                refrigerators and food shelves, walking through them with us and describing their
                                thoughts behind each food item.</p>
                            <p>We had each user answer a semi-structured interview to see what kind of problems they
                                were already thinking of and to see if we could dig up any underlying assumptions in
                                how they viewed the problem of food waste. We asked questions of how often they threw
                                out food, and for what reason. We asked for walkthroughs of their pantry and the
                                schedule of an average week of eating, cooking and storing food. </p>
                            <p>We discovered some key themes behind food storage and food waste: users are forgetful of
                                their current inventory and often buy food they already had, users are generally
                                uneducated regarding food storage, and are unsure of how long food can keep without
                                spoiling. We identified this as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-action_gap'>intention-behaviour
                                    gap</a>; people don’t intend to waste food, but a mixture of forgetfulness and
                                context made them waste food. We used these insights to design our app and fridge
                                mechanics.</p>

                            <p>Two internal cameras and weight sensors are used inside the Fridgit to dynamically
                                update its inventory on an embedded computer. Fridgit also tracks how long food items
                                have been in the fridge, how long they have until they spoil, food usage statistics,
                                and features a manual add feature when adding leftovers or take-out foods. The
                                companion app auto-updates a shopping list of food items when Fridgit notices that
                                you’re running out of a particular food.</p>

                            <p>Mortality rates, access to affordable healthcare, gross national income (GNI), and the
                                enrollment rates of tertiary education facilities are very important to the welfare of
                                a state, but how much do these indicators vary in developed versus developing nations?
                                Working on this project with 3 other students, we chose to investigate this question
                                further by looking at data from the World Databank. Specifically, data was gathered
                                from 10 different countries - 5 developed and 5 developing, and we tracked 9
                                indicators, including Total Urban/Rural population, mortality rates, and GNI.</p>
                            <p>When first coming across the massive dataset, the first thing on the agenda was to get
                                comfortable with the data. It was crucial to know what data was missing, which
                                indicators were necessary, and how to approach the data. We proceeded to scrub the data
                                of null values as they would affect statistical tests, and organized the data into
                                separate CSV files for each country and into one large master dataset. I imported them
                                all into R to run both general statistical summaries and correlation tests. We then
                                took each of the indicators and plotted the correlation matrices between each of them.</p>

                            <p>For the rendering of initial exploratory charts, I found that keeping the relevant
                                countries in a master dataset was a more effective method for generating charts. By
                                adding extra contextual information like the country name as well as whether it was
                                developed or undeveloped, it was easier to visualize the categorical differences in the
                                data. Eventually, in an attempt to make the data exploration more accessible to
                                viewers, I created interactive charts that could be viewed online using D3.js.</p>
